 ## FOR TASK 1
 
# Basic Mathematical Operations Program 
This Python program allows users to perform basic mathematical operations on two numbers provided as input. The program ensures reliability by handling division by zero gracefully.

# Features
Addition: Computes the sum of two numbers.
Subtraction: Calculates the difference between two numbers.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers together.
Division: Handles division of two numbers and avoids errors when dividing by zero.

# Example Output : 
 #eg - 1
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Addition:  15
Subtraction:  5
Multiplication:  50
Division:  2.0

#eg - 2 (Handles division by zero)
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 0
Addition:  8
Subtraction:  8
Multiplication:  0
Division:  undefined
## for TAsk 2 
# User Greeting Program

## Overview
This Python program prompts the user to enter their first and last name, then combines both to display a personalized greeting message.

## How It Works
1. The user is asked to input their first name.
2. The user is then asked to input their last name.
3. The program concatenates both names to create the full name.
4. Finally, the program prints a greeting message using the full name.

## Expected Output : 
Enter your first name: Aakash
Enter your last name: Sharma
Hello, Aakash Sharma! Welcome to the python program.  

  ## FOR  Factorial 
 # Factorial Calculator
## Overview
This Python program calculates the factorial of a given number using recursion. It also handles negative inputs gracefully by informing the user that factorials are not defined for negative numbers.

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter a number.
2. It checks whether the input is a valid integer.
3. If the number is negative, it returns an appropriate message.
4. If the number is `0` or `1`, it returns `1` (base case).
5. Otherwise, it recursively calculates the factorial for the given number.

## Expected Output : 
Example 1: Positive Number
Enter the number: 5
The Factorial of 5 is: 120

Example 2: Negative Number
Enter the number: -3
Factorial can't be defined for negative numbers

   ## MATH module 
   
# Mathematical Computation Program

## Overview
This Python program takes a user-input number and calculates the following using the built-in `math` module:
- Square root of the number
- Natural logarithm (log base e)
- Sine of the number (in radians)

## How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter a number.
2. It converts the input into a floating-point value for precision.
3. The program then performs mathematical operations using the `math` module:
   - Computes the square root (`math.sqrt(x)`)
   - Computes the natural logarithm (`math.log(x)`)
   - Computes the sine value (`math.sin(x)`)
4. The results are displayed in a structured output.

# Expected Output :
Enter the number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarithm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303

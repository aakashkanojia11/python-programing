 ## FOR TASK 1
 
# Basic Mathematical Operations Program 
This Python program allows users to perform basic mathematical operations on two numbers provided as input. The program ensures reliability by handling division by zero gracefully.

# Features
Addition: Computes the sum of two numbers.
Subtraction: Calculates the difference between two numbers.
Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers together.
Division: Handles division of two numbers and avoids errors when dividing by zero.

# Example Output : 
 #eg - 1
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Addition:  15
Subtraction:  5
Multiplication:  50
Division:  2.0

#eg - 2 (Handles division by zero)
Enter the first number: 8
Enter the second number: 0
Addition:  8
Subtraction:  8
Multiplication:  0
Division:  undefined
